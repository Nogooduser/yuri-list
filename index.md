The list is in alphabetical order to avoid any personal bias.  
There are no one-shots in this list, every title is at least 1 volume or a few chapters long.  
Anthologies are also not included in the main list and are instead in their own separate list below.    
All ongoing series in the list get regular updates so you can safely read and follow them!  
There is a stalled/dropped list below the main list so you can know what series to avoid (if they get updated I'll move them to the main list)  
The volume and chapter count is meant to help you pick something you feel comfortable reading in case you have time constraints (Note: a volume typically has 150-200 pages)  
I also have a list of series with yuri subtext below for those of us who appreciate yuri even in its smallest form

Notes:  
**Complete** means the series is fully translated  
**Ongoing** means the series is still being published  
**Scanlating** means the series has been complete but is not fully translated yet  
I put a **?** on the chapter number when the series is ongoing because I can't be bothered to update every single ongoing series' chapter numbers.

## Average Series

These series are all just okay in my view. I don't hate any of them, but they just didn't provide me with much to feel

**Title**|**Reason**
---|---
[Green](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/green)|It started alright and then had a really rushed ending that sort of undermined everything that came before it
[Her World](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/her_world)|It seemed kind of interesting at first but the story really doesn't have anything to it
[If This Wish Comes True](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/if_this_wish_comes_true)|I actually enjoyed the sequel/spin-off *All You* but the original work was way too much of a cheesy and rushed soap opera
[President and Vice-President](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/president_and_vice_president)|Silly forced drama and very rushed development for what amounts to a rather basic and generic love story
[Saki](https://mangadex.org/manga/160/saki)|You might hate me for putting this here, but Saki honestly has some really bad pacing issues that very negatively impact the experience imo
[Salomelic](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/salomelic)|This story needed more chapters to be well paced, instead it just kind of rushes through everything just to get to a really cliche ending
[The Miko's Words and the Witch's Incantations](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/the_mikos_words_and_the_witchs_incantations)|It was a bit cute but the story had no substance and it was way too cliche and rushed for my taste

---

## Yuri Subtext Series

All these series have a noticeable degree of yuri subtext, but unfortunately none of them go all the way 

**Title**|**Notes**
---|---
[Bokura wa Minna Ikiteiru!](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/bokura_wa_minna_ikiteiru)|It was so close to being yuri
[Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka?](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/gochuumon_wa_usagi_desu_ka)|This one is pretty much a yuri, they just need to confess
[Hitoribocchi no OO Seikatsu](https://mangadex.org/manga/14508/hitoribocchi-no-oo-seikatsu)|I think everyone in here is just gay one way or another
[Itsuka Minoreba](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/someday_well_get_there)|Cute girls playing games. I am still hopeful for a yuri ending
[Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViViD](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/mahou_shoujo_lyrical_nanoha_vivid)|Much like her mother, Vivid is definitely going dowth the path of lilies
[New Game!](https://mangadex.org/manga/13622/new-game)|Just a little push and this could easily have yuri
[Non Non Biyori](https://mangadex.org/manga/2459/non-non-biyori)|Hotaru fawning over Komachi is pretty much the reason I follow this
[Slow Start](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/slow_start)|I am 99% sure everyone here is a lesbian and they're just waiting for their partners to come out first
[Stretch](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/stretch)|Has a somewhat bittersweet end. I'm pretty sure the author wanted to make this yuri but couldn't get to it
[Sweet Magic Syndrome](https://mangadex.org/manga/9400/sweet-magic-syndrome)|This was so sweet and fluffy, but sadly it ended very abruptly and doesn't really go anywhere
[Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/tonari_no_kyuuketsuki_san)|So far only one of the girls has a big yuri crush, but maybe one day the other will too
[Youkai Gakuenki](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/youkai_gakuenki)|It was very sweet and yuri-ish despite never going all the way

---

## Awful series

I loathe all these series. You might like them, so I put them here just in case, but I absolutely do not recommend them to anyone.

**Title**|**Reason**
---|---
[Banana no Nana](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/banana_no_nana)|This series is so inconceivably stupid and ridiculous its only redeeming quality is that you can read it and laugh at how absurd it all is.
[Cocytus](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/cocytus)|Every single character in this is a piece of shit and it might actually be one of the worst manga I've ever read as a whole
[Netsuzou Trap](https://mangadex.org/manga/14313/netsuzou-trap-ntr)|It's telling when the most likeable character in your yuri series is a man. Avoid this like the plague unless you're so into NTR that you don't even care if the story/yuri is bad
[Shitsurakuen](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/shitsurakuen)|Girls suffer 24/7. Premise was somewhat interesting but is ruined by the execution and the ending. Oh and every lesbian girl aside from the protagonist turns straight because  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
