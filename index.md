The list is in alphabetical order to avoid any personal bias.  
There are no one-shots in this list, every title is at least 1 volume or a few chapters long.  
Anthologies are also not included in the main list and are instead in their own separate list below.    
All ongoing series in the list get regular updates so you can safely read and follow them!  
There is a stalled/dropped list below the main list so you can know what series to avoid (if they get updated I'll move them to the main list)  
The volume and chapter count is meant to help you pick something you feel comfortable reading in case you have time constraints (Note: a volume typically has 150-200 pages)  
I also have a list of series with yuri subtext below for those of us who appreciate yuri even in its smallest form

Notes:  
**Complete** means the series is fully translated  
**Ongoing** means the series is still being published  
**Scanlating** means the series has been complete but is not fully translated yet  
I put a **?** on the chapter number when the series is ongoing because I can't be bothered to update every single ongoing series' chapter numbers.

## Stalled/Dropped/Canceled Series

I like quite a lot of these series, but because they never finished I can't in good faith put them in the main list. Feel free to check them out at your own risk though.

## Average Series

These series are all just okay in my view. I don't hate any of them, but they just didn't provide me with much to feel

**Title**|**Reason**
---|---
[1 x ½](https://mangadex.org/title/23424/1-x)|While I'm not bothered by the incest I just feel like the series can't really execute it well enough, it's more like the author just wants to put a daughter and a mother together and that's that.
[Girls x Sexual Harassment Life](https://mangadex.org/title/29910/girls-x-sexual-harassment-life)|The punchline is way too overused to be funny, plus the main character just isn't very likeable. It's not like in Shouraiteki ni Shinde Kure where there are at least interesting scenarios and the two MCs actually have some chemistry.
[Green](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/green)|It started alright and then had a really rushed ending that sort of undermined everything that came before it
[Her World](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/her_world)|It seemed kind of interesting at first but the story really doesn't have anything to it
[If This Wish Comes True](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/if_this_wish_comes_true)|I actually enjoyed the sequel/spin-off *All You* but the original work was way too much of a cheesy and rushed soap opera
[Kanaete! Yuri Yousei](https://mangadex.org/title/30072/kanaete-yuri-yousei)|While it did make me laugh there's just too little substance for it to be on the first list.
[Mikazuki no Carte](https://mangadex.org/title/23419/mikazuki-no-carte)|Although I like my age gap series the story in this one just isn't very compelling with most of the events being way too cookie cutter for my taste
[President and Vice-President](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/president_and_vice_president)|Silly forced drama and very rushed development for what amounts to a rather basic and generic love story
[Saki](https://mangadex.org/manga/160/saki)|You might hate me for putting this here, but Saki honestly has some really bad pacing issues that very negatively impact the experience imo
[Salomelic](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/salomelic)|This story needed more chapters to be well paced, instead it just kind of rushes through everything just to get to a really cliche ending
[The Miko's Words and the Witch's Incantations](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/the_mikos_words_and_the_witchs_incantations)|It was a bit cute but the story had no substance and it was way too cliche and rushed for my taste
[Two Lives in the Same House](https://mangadex.org/title/30379/two-lives-in-the-same-house)|Fun concepte but ultimately very average development and conclusion, also felt more like a porno than a proper story half the time.

## Yuri Subtext Series

All these series have a noticeable degree of yuri subtext, but unfortunately none of them go all the way 

**Title**|**Notes**
---|---
[A-Channel](https://mangadex.org/title/6687/a-channel)|Fun slice of life with lots of subtext
[Bokura wa Minna Ikiteiru!](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/bokura_wa_minna_ikiteiru)|It was so close to being yuri
[Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka?](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/gochuumon_wa_usagi_desu_ka)|This one is pretty much a yuri, they just need to confess
[Hitoribocchi no OO Seikatsu](https://mangadex.org/manga/14508/hitoribocchi-no-oo-seikatsu)|I think everyone in here is just gay one way or another
[Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha ViViD](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/mahou_shoujo_lyrical_nanoha_vivid)|Much like her mother, Vivid is definitely going dowth the path of lilies
[New Game!](https://mangadex.org/manga/13622/new-game)|Just a little push and this could easily have yuri
[Non Non Biyori](https://mangadex.org/manga/2459/non-non-biyori)|Hotaru fawning over Komachi is pretty much the reason I follow this
[Shinmai Shimai no Futari Gohan](http://www.yuri-ism.net/slide/series/shinmai_shimai_no_futari_gohan/)|This series is an absolute treat as a slice of life, there's barely any hint of yuri but the two main characters have such a nice and friendly relationship that I am obligted to put it here.
[Slow Start](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/slow_start)|I am 99% sure everyone here is a lesbian and they're just waiting for their partners to come out first
[Stretch](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/stretch)|Has a somewhat bittersweet end. I'm pretty sure the author wanted to make this yuri but couldn't get to it
[Sweet Magic Syndrome](https://mangadex.org/manga/9400/sweet-magic-syndrome)|This was so sweet and fluffy, but sadly it ended very abruptly and doesn't really go anywhere
[Tonari no Kyuuketsuki-san](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/tonari_no_kyuuketsuki_san)|So far only one of the girls has a big yuri crush, but maybe one day the other will too
[Youkai Gakuenki](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/youkai_gakuenki)|It was very sweet and yuri-ish despite never going all the way

## Awful series

I loathe all these series. You might like them, so I put them here just in case, but I absolutely do not recommend them to anyone.

**Title**|**Reason**
---|---
[Banana no Nana](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/banana_no_nana)|This series is so inconceivably stupid and ridiculous its only redeeming quality is that you can read it and laugh at how absurd it all is.
[Cocytus](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/cocytus)|Every single character in this is a piece of shit and it might actually be one of the worst manga I've ever read as a whole
[Itsuka Minoreba](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/someday_well_get_there)|Originally in the subtext section, the series ended up being a massive disappointment with a very underdeveloped story and characters that went nowhere.
[Netsuzou Trap](https://mangadex.org/manga/14313/netsuzou-trap-ntr)|It's telling when the most likeable character in your yuri series is a man. Avoid this like the plague unless you're so into NTR that you don't even care if the story/yuri is bad
[Onee-san wa Joshi Shougakusei ni Kyoumi ga Arimasu](https://mangadex.org/title/26432/onee-san-wa-joshi-shougakusei-ni-kyoumi-ga-arimasu)|The main character is a straight up self admitted pedophile who wants to molest an actual kid and whose behavior is completely excused because she is a woman. Just... no.
[Shitsurakuen](https://dynasty-scans.com/series/shitsurakuen)|Girls suffer 24/7. Premise was somewhat interesting but is ruined by the execution and the ending. Oh and every lesbian girl aside from the protagonist turns straight because  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
[Shoujo Shikkaku](https://mangadex.org/title/16094/shoujo-shikkaku)|This was an absolute mess on all fronts. The story is a battle royale where 80% of the cast just gets instantly murdered to leave the main characters to do their thing, and then it drops a plot twists that has zero reason to be there other than being a plot twist, ending on a note that has nothing to do with what the series was about in the first place.
